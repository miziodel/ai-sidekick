# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Antigravity Migration**: We are restructuring the repository to align with the "Quality First" methodology and professional "Arc Expert" identity.

### Current Goals
1.  Establish `.agent/rules` (Done).
2.  Migrate Documentation to `docs/` (In Progress).
3.  Move code to `src/` (Planned).

## Recent Changes
- Created `00-arc-expert-identity.md` and `01-tech-constraints.md`.
- Split `project_status.md` into `docs/status.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, and `docs/roadmap.md`.
- Migrated lessons learned to `docs/knowledge-base.md`.

## Active Questions
- Will the `src/` move break `manifest.json` paths? (Mitigation: `tests/audit_paths.js` planned).
